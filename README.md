# Piet WASM (WASI) - WIP

## Description

## Requirements
The `zig` toolchain is used here to simplify the process of building the `npiet` interpreter
that is written in C, by the way the `npiet.wasm` is already included so the build is not mandatory.


## Setup

```
$ make
```

The default `serve` rule will compile the `npiet` interpreter and install it.
